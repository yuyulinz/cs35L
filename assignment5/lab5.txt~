I downloaded the coreutils file with bug and unzipped it
> tar -xvf coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz

I went into the resulting folder
> cd coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz

I then tried to build it by configure and make
> ./configure CL
> make

Configure succeeded but the make command did not. There was an error message
about conflicting types for 'futimens'

I downloaded the patch by using wget with the url found on the specs page
> wget http://cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter16/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff

I patched it with the flas -p0 since we did not have to strip any prefixes
> patch-p0 < coreutils.diff

This patch renames the tee and futimens functions so that they are not in
conflict with other functions that have the same name. This will allow the
program to build properly. (for example futimens was renamed to
coreutils_futimens and tee was renamed to coreutils_tee)

I rebuilt the program and now make works

To recreate the bug, I first created a temporary directory, I then followed the
list of instructions on the specs page to recreate the bug.
> mkdir temp
> cd temp
> touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
> touch now
> sleep 1
> touch now1
> TZ=UTCO ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1

The problem is that even though armistice is the oldest file, the program lists
it as the newest file.

To examine this bug I first opened the source file ls.c in emacs
> emacs ls.c
>
