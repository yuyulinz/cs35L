1. The data going through the network is encrypted so if the other teams had
tapped into our connection, they would not be able to decrypt the messages
and our connection is still secure. If they had tapped into our keystrokes,
our data would still not have been compromised so long as we do not type any
data. In this lab, we only typed in the public key, however, if we typed out
data on our keyboards, such as passwords or passphrases, then our data would be
compromised and this could potentially be an issue. If they had control of our
usb, then they will have our private key which means they have ful control and
access to everything we send to each other. The weakness in this setup is that
you lost control of the usb in the first place.

2. gpg --verify does't actually verify that you personally created the tar file
because it only verifys the integrity of the file. It doesn't keep track of who
created it. An attacker can just use the same public key to intercept a file and
sign as a different name. A solution to this is to have a third party document
every public key and who each key belongs to. The tradeoff to this is that we
are putting trust into someone else to do their job correctly.
