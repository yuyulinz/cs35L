Lab 6
********************************************************************************

The goal of this lab is to set up a connection with another student's host and
run programs that forward to your machine.

First I restarted into Ubuntu.

I made sure openssh-client and openssh-server were installed.
This command shows which ssh I have installed
> $ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
These two commands are used to install the two open ssh programs
> $ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
> $ sudo apt-get install openssh-client

****************************************
Set up host
****************************************

Generate public and private keys
> $ ssh-keygen

Create an account for the client on the server
> $ sudo useradd -d /user/partner -m Partnet
> $

****************************************
Connect as client
