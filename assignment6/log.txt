Lab 6
********************************************************************************

The goal of this lab is to set up a connection with another student's host and
run programs that forward to your machine.

First I restarted into Ubuntu.

I made sure openssh-client and openssh-server were installed.
This command shows which ssh I have installed
> $ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
These two commands are used to install the two open ssh programs
> $ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
> $ sudo apt-get install openssh-client

Check IP address and reachability of a host
> $ ifconfig
> ping <ip_addr>

****************************************
Set up host
****************************************

Check IP address 
> $ ifconfig
> ping 

Generate public and private keys
> $ ssh-keygen

Create an account for the client on the server
> $ sudo useradd -d /user/username -m Username
> $ sudo passwd Username

Create ssh directory for new user
> $ cd /home/username
> $ sudo mkdir .ssh

Change ownership and permission on .ssh directory
> $ sudo chown -R username .ssh
> $ sudo chmod 700 .ssh
The last line will give read, write and execute permissions

When my partner ssh'd into my host, the ip address matched and the connection
was successful.

****************************************
Connect as client
****************************************

generate public and private keys
> $ ssh-keygen
We set location of keys to be /home/ubuntu/.ssh
When prompted for pass phrase, left it blank

Copy public key to server
Partner at this point created a username and used ifconfig to check ip address
> $ ssh-copy-id -i UserName@server_ip_addr

Add private key to authentication agent
> $ ssd-add

SSH to server (either one will work. -X will enable X11 session forwarding
> $ ssh UserName@server_ip_addr
> $ ssh -X UserName@server_ip_addr

running a command
> $ xterm
> $ firefox
> $ gedit

checked if addr to see if it matches host
> $ ifconfig
ip address matchec

connected.
