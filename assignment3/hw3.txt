Q.3
Running the program with an empty file will make it return errors. Because the
function chooseline in the class randline is supposed to return a random line
within self.lines, it cannot choose one in this case since there are no lines
to choose from. There is a index error in the random.choice function. The error
message:

 return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))] # raises IndexError if seq is empty
 IndexError: list index out of range

shows that the random.choice function is trying to select a random value but
since seq is empty, there is an IndexError. Ultimately, the program tries
to select a random line in the file but cannot since there are no lines.

Q.4

File "randline.py", line 65
  except IOError as (errno, strerror):
  	 	    ^

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This problem has to do with the fact that python3 removes automatic tuple
unpacking. In python 2, you are able to iterate through parameters in an
exception by using the parenthesis and comma. Python3 removes this and now
(errno, strerror) must either be replaced with err or srrno_strerror.
