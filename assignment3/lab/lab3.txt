SETUP
-Downloaded coreutils-7.6.tar.gz by using wget
-created coreutilsinstall directory in home directory
-untarred and unzipped the file using tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
-configured into coreutilsintall directory by using
 ./configure --prefix=/u/eng/ugrad/yulin/coreutilsinstall
-ran make and make install
-reproduced problem by navigating to ~/coreutilsinstall/bin/ and then running
 ./ls -l
 the dates were in YYYY-MM-DD format instead of tradittional unix date

PATCH
-A patch fizes problems in code, a diff file contains the changes and we use the
 patch command with the diff file to add changes.
-used wget to get the html for the patch
-editted using vim the file to only have the patch
-renamed the file to patch_file
-used command patch -p1 < patch_file to apply the patch
 -pnum command will strip the smallest prefix containing num leading slashes
 from each file name found in the patch. Since we need to stip the first prefix
 we must use -p1.
-used the make command to build the fixed version

 the make command will go into every directory to check if there are files
 needed to be recompiled. most of the directories did not have files that needed
 to be recompiled except for src and man. The output for src is as follows

 CC    ls.o
 CCLD  dir
 CCLD  vdir
 CCLD  ls

 Here it recognizes that the src code for ls has been changed so it recompiles
 it creating another object file and updates the other files that are dependent
 on it.

 GEN dir.1
 GEN vdir.1
 GEN ls.1

 make also goes into lib, doc, po, tests, and gnulib-tests but there were no
 changes to be made

-after going into coreutils-7.6/src/ and calling ./ls -l, the modified ls now
 works and no longer displays YYYY-MM-DD format.
-the installed ls still does not output the right format.

-Created a new file using touch newfile and tested both installed and modified
 ls programs. The installed ls did not output the correct format while the new
 ls had the correct format.

-Created a new file using touch and set the time to be -t 201401210959.30
 the timestamp should be 9:59.30 1/21/2014

 again the modified ls had the correct format and the installed ls did not

Q1. The "case_long_iso_time_style:" is not needed because the goto line was
    removed. However, it did not need to be deleted since the switch statement
    has a case above it that did not have a break and will fall through and
    execute the code below anyways.

Q2. This patch poses a problem if the English date format is not standard.
    Users in another country will have difficulties wince the locale is set.
    Applications that need to use the three numerical dates will also fail
    since the the months are now replaced with words and the year is only
    displayed if it is old enough.
