1. man -k 'searchword'        found in man page of man

2. /usr/local/cs/bin/cp /usr/bin/cp   found by using the command whereis -b cp
   /usr/local/cs/bin/wc /usr/bin/wc   found by using the command whereis -b wc

3. X - a executable for the X server used to control graphical interface
   w - shows who is logged on and what they are doing
   [ - a shell program that acts like the command test which checks file types and compares values

   To find these three executables, I used the command find /usr/bin -name '?'
   I then checked each of the three resulting files using the command
   ls -l /usr/bin/X for all three files to see if were executable.

4. /usr/bin/emacs is a softlink to /etc/alternatives/emacs
   /etx/alternatives/emacs is a softlink to /usr/bin/emacs-24.3

   When calling /usr/bin/emacs, you are actually calling emacs-24.3

   Used symbolic link command (ls -l /usr/bin/emacs) and (ls -l /etc/alternatives/emacs)

5. g+s: g - group and refers to the permissions other users in the file's group have
   	s - set user or group ID on execution
	g+s - Adds SUID permission to group
   o-x  o - others or users who are neither in the files group nor own the file
   	x - execute
	o-x - causes executable mode bits to be removed from all other users. Other users will not be able to execute the file

   Used man chmod to find this information

6. find -mtime -21

   Used man find to find information about this. The negative before the 21 means show the files since the last 21 days. Using
   + will mean show the files modified at least 22 days ago.

7. find /usr -type d -mtime -21

   /usr specifies where to search, -type d searches for directories, -mtime -21 searches for modified files within the last 3 weeks
   At first I used / instead of /usr but this resulted in a loop. specifying /usr solves this problem

   Information found in the man page for find

8. There are 287 symbolic links in the same directory as find which is /usr/bin

   I used find /usr/bin -type l | wc -l

   -type l searches for only symbolic types
   wc -l counds the newlines

9. the oldest file is kbd

   I first cd into /usr/lib
   Then I used ls -lt to list all files by time

   -l means use long listing format
   -t means to sort by modification time

   There were two files that were last modified in 2014, alsa and kbd
   I used stat kbd and stat alsa to get more information

   kbd was last modified in september 2014
   alsa was last modified in december 2014

   therefore, kbd is the oldest

10. Locale gets its data from LANG, LC_*, and NLSPATH environment variables.

    Found this information in the man pages of locale

12. C-M-a - Move backward to the beginning of a defun
    C-M-b - Move backward over a balanced expression
    C-M-c - Exit from the innermost recursive edit or minibuffer
    C-M-d - Move down one level of parentheses
    C-M-e - Move forward to next end of defun
    C-M-f - Move forward over a balanced expression
    C-M-h - Put mark at end of this defun, point at beginning. Put region around whole current or following defun

    Found these in emacs manual particularly in the key index

13. C-g is the way to get rid of a partially typed command, or a numeric argument that you don't want.
    Furthermore, if you are in the middle of a command that is running, it stops the command in a safe way.

    Found in the emacs manual particularly in the key index

14. Yank Reinserts "paste" the last stretch of killed text. Reinsert the most recent kill, which is the stretch of     killed text most recently killed or yanked.

    Found this in by going into emacs and then typing "C-h f yank" which pulls up the help window for this command

15. Emacs dired lists more files than ls -l. It will list the root and subdirectories directories.

    Found this by doing a visual comparison.
