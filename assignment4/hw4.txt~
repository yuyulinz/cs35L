Checked out version 3.0 into a new branch called "quote"
> git checkout v3.0 -b quote

Patched from lab
> patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

When I tried to patch the program, it says the file has already been patched.
When I tried to ignore the error, it says the patching has failed.
I instead created another directory in my home called gitroot2 and cloned
another repository and after copying quote-3.0-patch.txt to it, applied the
patch. This ended up solving my problem and all 6 files were patched.

Then I went into src directory and using emacs, went into every modified file
and changed the ChangeLog using the c-x 4 a command. I added a short description
to each file.
> emacs diff.c
> c-x 4 a
(Do this for the other 5 files)

Commited changes to the new branch withc the ChangeLog entry as commit message
> git commit -F ChangeLog

Generated formatted-patch.txt file using git format-patch
> git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

I tested Jonathan Cheung's patch
> git checkout v3.0 -b partner
> git am < formatted-patch-partner.txt
> ./bootstrap
> ./configure
> make
> make check
My partners patch worked successfully and his make check also was good.

Next to check to see if my own version is working, I did the same thing.
I checked out another version of diffutils and put it in the mypatch branch.
I then applied my patch using the git am command
> git checkout v3.0 -b mypatch
> git am < formatted-patch.txt

I built this version of Diffutils
> ./bootstrap
> ./configure
> make
> make check

I then ran these commands to check if my comments were in the ChangeLog
> make distdir
> cd diffutils*
> emacs ChangeLog

In the ChangeLog file, I see my message that I left as well as my name and email


At first I had trouble getting the GUI interface of gitk to work but I found
that using the SSH Lnx icon on the remote desktop worked.
