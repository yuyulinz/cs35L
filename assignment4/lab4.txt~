I first created a directory and then went into the new directory
> mkdir gitroot
> cd gitroot

I then got a copy of the repository of Diffutils and went into the repository
> git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git
> cd diffutils

Next I used git log and git tag to put the log and list of tags into txt files
> git log > git-log.txt
> git tag . git-tags.txt

Next I went into the log of commits to search fot the commit that starts with
"quote 'like this'" by using git log and /quote 'like this'
> git log
> /quote 'like this'

The commit hashcode was very long so I copied it by using right click and then
used git show to create a patch file
> git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcd191a4ef04ae9ed4f > quote-patch.txt

To check out version 3.0 of diffutils, I used the git checkout
> git checkout v3.0

To patch version 3.0, I used the following command
> patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt
Because p1 stips the first prefix, some files were not found. I skipped over
those by pressing  <enter>

Used git status to see the overview of what happened
> git status
This showed a list of modified files and then a list of untracked files
